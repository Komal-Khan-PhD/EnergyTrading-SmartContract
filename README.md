# Blockchain-Based P2P Energy Trading – Smart Contract

This repository contains the smart contract developed for the paper:

**A Real Pilot-Platform Implementation for Blockchain-Based Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading**

The full paper and additional open-source resources detail the complete system (covering IoT integration, mobile application, and local aggregator services). This repository is intended to showcase the Solidity-based contract that forms the core of the pilot P2P energy trading platform.

## Overview

This smart contract is part of a blockchain-based pilot platform that enables peer-to-peer energy trading. It implements the essential functions for participants to:
  
- **Create Trading Offers:** Prosumers can add energy sale offers specifying amount, price, and time.
- **Accept Offers:** Consumers can pick offers, initiating the trading process.
- **Confirm Transactions:** Functions for confirmation of energy delivery and payments secure the transaction flow.

For the full context, technical details, and system implementation, please refer to the original paper and open-source repositories linked below.

## Repository Structure

  - Contains the Solidity smart contract file implementing core trading features.
- **README.md**
  - This file providing a brief overview and guidance to the complete project details.

## Getting Started

To review and deploy the smart contract:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile and Deploy:**

   Use your preferred Ethereum development framework (e.g., Hardhat or Truffle). For example, with Hardhat:

   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

## Further Information

For additional details—such as the complete platform architecture, integration with IoT devices, and the mobile interface—please refer to:

- The published paper: "A Real Pilot-Platform Implementation for Blockchain-Based Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading"  
- Other open-source resources provided in the paper and linked within.

This repository focuses solely on the smart contract component; the remainder of the implementation is available as open source through the cited channels.
